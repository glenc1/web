<h4>
Overview
</h4>

<p>
 League of Legends, commonly refered to as Lol, is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena video game created by Riot Games in 2009. League of Legends is free to play
 on windows and mac devices. In game, you control a character called a "Champion." Each Champion has their own unique set of abilities and playstyles. Also, you are
 divided into two teams of five, where you work with your team to defend your base and destroy the opposing base. Based in the map "Summoner's Rift" the field is 
 split into two sides, occupied by either team. Located at the center of a team's base is the Nexus. If a team is able to destroy the oppoisng team's Nexus, they 
 will win. In doing so, teamwork and coordination is neccesary in order to succeed. This is why League of Legends is a team-based game. 
  
 In addition to the base itself, on Summoner's Rift, there are three lanes where you are able to take your champion to. The lane at the top of the map is called 
 "Top Lane." The lane in the middle of the map is called "Middle Lane." And the lane at the bottom of the map if called "Bottom Lane." Each lane is home to a 
 different selection of champions which are more likely to do well when played in their respective lane. Traditionally, one player goes top, one player goes mid, 
 and two players go bot. One player on each team will play the Jungle role which occupies the areas between the lanes. Around every minute, a wave of mimions will
 be sent down the lanes. While the minions are quite week, they will attack enemy minions, champions, and structures. Killing a minion gives a small amount of gold.
 In the jungle, the jungler will fight Jungle Camps which are mini-neutral objectives that also give gold when killed.
  
 In each lane, there are two towers. Towers will attack enemies and protect you. In order to get closer to destroying the Nexus, you have to destroy the towers
 first. After the two towers in the lane are destroyed, you will reach the first part of the base. At the forefront is another tower infront of an inhibitor. The
 inhibitor does not attack anything. When the inhibitor is destroyed your minions will get a buff. Lastly, in the center of the base lies two more towers and the 
 nexus. These are the two strongest towers on the map, and are harder to destroy. When they are completely destroyed, you will be able to attack the nexus. As,
 stated earlier on, when the Nexus is destroyed, the game ends.
