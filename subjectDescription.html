<h4>
Overview
</h4>

<p>
 League of Legends, commonly refered to as Lol, is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena video game created by Riot Games in 2009. League of Legends is free to play
 on windows and mac devices. In game, you control a character called a "Champion." Each Champion has their own unique set of abilities and playstyles. Also, you are
 divided into two teams of five, where you work with your team to defend your base and destroy the opposing base. Based in the map "Summoner's Rift" the field is 
 split into two sides, occupied by either team. Located at the center of a team's base is the Nexus. If a team is able to destroy the oppoisng team's Nexus, they 
 will win. In doing so, teamwork and coordination is neccesary in order to succeed. This is why League of Legends is a team-based game. 
</p>

<p> 
 In addition to the base itself, on Summoner's Rift, there are three lanes where you are able to take your champion to. The lane at the top of the map is called 
 "Top Lane." The lane in the middle of the map is called "Middle Lane." And the lane at the bottom of the map if called "Bottom Lane." Each lane is home to a 
 different selection of champions which are more likely to do well when played in their respective lane. Traditionally, one player goes top, one player goes mid, 
 and two players go bot. One player on each team will play the Jungle role which occupies the areas between the lanes. Around every minute, a wave of mimions will
 be sent down the lanes. While the minions are quite week, they will attack enemy minions, champions, and structures. Killing a minion gives a small amount of gold.
 In the jungle, the jungler will fight Jungle Camps which are mini-neutral objectives that also give gold when killed.
</p>

<p>
 In each lane, there are two towers. Towers will attack enemies and protect you. In order to get closer to destroying the Nexus, you have to destroy the towers
 first. After the two towers in the lane are destroyed, you will reach the first part of the base. At the forefront is another tower infront of an inhibitor. The
 inhibitor does not attack anything. When the inhibitor is destroyed your minions will get a buff. Lastly, in the center of the base lies two more towers and the 
 nexus. These are the two strongest towers on the map, and are harder to destroy. When they are completely destroyed, you will be able to attack the nexus. As,
 stated earlier on, when the Nexus is destroyed, the game ends.

<h4>
 Gold and Items
</h4>

<p>
In League of Legends, killing most things will give you gold. Killing a minion can give anywhere from 14 to 90 gold, a Champion kill will give you anywhere from 
300 to 1,000 gold, and destroying a tower will give you 300 gold. With this gold, you can purchase items that buff up your champion and give stats. Most completed
items cost around 3,000 gold, while the components of those items cost around 1,000 gold. Different champion classes build different items that give different 
stats. Each player can have at most six items. It is recommended on all champions to buy a "Mythic Item." Mythic Items are items that give above average stats for 
there cost. Usually players tend to buy there Mythic Item as soon as possible. Each player can only build one Mythic.

<h4>
 Champions
</h4>

<p>
In each game, the player has the choice to choose what Champion they want to play. There are more than 150 playable champions that all have their own unique
abilities. There are many different classes that a champion may fit in. Champion classes are mostly dependant on what items they build, what lane they do best in,
and their damage type.
</p>

<p>
Each champion has their design and set of abilites that are unique to them. Every champion, except for a few, has three basic abilities, and an ultimate ability. 
To start, a champions basic abilites are binded to the Q, W, and E, keys respectively. Most champion's Q abilites do small amounts of damage, on low cooldowns. 
Next, most champion's W abilities have some sort of crowd control, which hinders enemy movement. Lastly, most champion's E abilites are a type of dash or movement.
Moving on to the Ultimate ability, each champion has one ability binded to the R key, that is their most powerful spell. It is likely to have a much longer cooldown
compared to the other abilities, but its effects are much more useful. A lot of champion's ultimate abilites are their largest output of damage.

<h4>
 Roles
</h4>

<p>
League of Legends has a wide variety of Champions to choose from. Each champion is unique in their own way, and they can be grouped by their roles. There are 5
main roles, top, jungle, mid, bot, and support. Each role has many different classes that can be played effectively.
</p>

<h5>
 Top
</h5>

<p>
 The top lane is the lane most isolated from the rest of the map. It is a 1v1 matchup and requires individual skill and decision making. The most common classes
 of champions played in the top lane are tanks and bruisers. These classes are best suited for the top lane due to their strong dueling power. These types of 
 champions are not that team reliant and can do most things on their own. The tanks job in the team is to be as hard to kill as possible. They are the person that
 stands in the frontline for the team and blocks as much incoming damage as possible. The tank will do as much as possible to act as a shield for your easier to
 kill allies behind you. In additon to this, the tank has very strong engage potential with their ultimates, usually being large crowd control abilties. Tanks are 
 a vital part of any team. Next, bruisers are similar to tanks in that they are decently hard to kill. In comparison to tanks, bruisers have less defense stats,
 but more damage. Bruisers excel in one on one duels due to their high damage and survivability. The bruisers job is to deal as much damage as possible during a
 teamfight will also protecting the rest of your team. Bruisers are a very strong class as their stats are high across the board. Popular champions in the top lane
 are Camille, Ornn, Renekton, Darius, and Garen.
</p>

<h5>
 Jungle
</h5>

<p>
 The jungle is the only role in the game that does not reside in one of the three lanes. Instead the jungler goes from lane to lane helping out their teamates, 
 while also farming jungle camps. Jungle is one of the hardest roles in the game to play for newer players due to its unique style. More experienced players will
 excel in this role due to its extreme impact potential on the game. The most common classes of champions played in the Jungle are fighters and bruisers. These
 classes are well suited for the Jungle due to their strong dueling potential and ability to help their teamates. Also, junglers need to be able to clear the 
 jungle camps as fast as possible, bruisers and fighters are the best at doing so. It is the Jungler's responsibility to help their teamates in the lanes defeat 
 their opponents. This is called ganking. When a Jungler ganks, it is most likely an attempt to get a kill on an opponent. Bruisers and fighets have an easier time
 doing this because of their high damage and set up potential. Most champions in these classes have abilities that do lots of damage while also keeping their 
 defensive stats high, therefore making ganking a lot easier. Popular champions in the jungle are Graves, Kindred, Udyr, and Amumu.
</p>

<h5>
 Mid
</h5>

<p>
 Similarly to the jungle, the mid lane has a lot of potential to help the rest of the team. The lane is a one on one lane, in the center of the map and is equally 
 far away from every point on the map. This means that that traveling out of lane from mid is very easy to do. Also, the mid lane is the shortest lane out of the 
 three. The most common classes of champions played in the midlane are mages and assassains. Both of these classes have very high damage, but low defensive stats.
 This makes for a great midlaner considering that the lane is a one on one. Both mages and assassains are very good at killing large amounts of minions in a short
 amount of time. This allows them to be able to spend more time out of lane. A benefit of the midlane being at the center of the map is that it allows you to be 
 able to roam to another lane. You are able to quickly rotate around the map and pick up a kill or two because of your high damage and mobility. The mid lane is 
 one of the strongest roles in the game and can carry game very easily. In teamfights the midlaner is looking to do as much damage as possible. If you are playing a
 mage, will position very far behind your frontline and try to output as much damage as possible with your high range and crowd control. If you are playing an 
 assassain, your goal is to look for an angle where you can sneak up on enemy carries without them being able to react in time. Assassains have some of the highest
 damage levels in the game and can easily kill someone in a matter of seconds. Popular champions in the mid lane are Zed, Syndra, Azir, Fizz, and Ahri.
</p>

<h5>
  Bot
</h5>

<p>
 Moving onto the bot lane, the bot laner shares the lane with the support. The bot laner is typically very week earlier into the game. This is why they are paired
 with a support to help them get to the later stages in the game. Also known as an ADC, the bot laner is one of the most consistent sources of damage in a team,
 having very high DPS. As of now, bot lane is one of the weaker roles in the game, and also one of the most difficult. This puts a lot of pressure on bot laners
 as they have to play near perfect every game to get things done. The most common class of champions played in the bot lane are marksmen. Having very high range and
 damage makes them a strong, reliant damage source. In a teamfight the bot laner is usally all the way in the back behind the tanks and other frontline. Getting 
 hit by even a small bit of damage or crowd control could end the fight for you. As a result, positioning correctly is key to effectivly playing a bot laner. With
 that being said, if you are able to play at that level, bot laners are extremely useful and powerful. Popular champions in the bot lane are Kai'sa, Vayne, Jinx, 
 Jhin, and Tristana.
</p>

<h5>
 Support
</h5>

<p>
 Lastly, the other role in the bot lane is the support. The support main job is to assist the team as much as possible, primarily the bot laner. Most supports 
 come equipped with heals and shields to use on your teammates to preven them from dying. Support can also be the main setup for your team as their ability kits
 are packed with powerful crowd control abilites. Also, supports are the most responsible for providing your team with vision. Support tend to be the silent heros
 as their job can easily be unnoticed. The most common classes of champions played as a support are enchanters and tanks. Enchanters and tanks are very different,
 in many aspects, one being their objectives. Enchanters are looking to stay closer to the backline and carries to keep them as strong as possible by providing 
 heals, shields, and powerups. Tanks on the other hand are looking to either keep enemies off of your carries by blocking them with crowd control, of getting large
 engages off to get some kills in fights. In a teamfight the enchanter stays in the backline with the carries, behind the tanks. Similarly to the bot laner, the 
 enchanter does not have much defense for themself. Comparitively, the tank support is supposed to be in the front line soaking up the damage for your team. Also 
 they are always supposed to be looking to use their abilities to catch enemies off guard for a kill. Popular champions in the support role are Leona, Nautilus,
 Yuumi, Soraka, Tahm Kench, Braum, and Thresh.
