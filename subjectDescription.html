<h4>
Overview
</h4>

<p>
 League of Legends, commonly refered to as Lol, is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena video game created by Riot Games in 2009. League of Legends is free to play
 on windows and mac devices. In game, you control a character called a "Champion." Each Champion has their own unique set of abilities and playstyles. Also, you are
 divided into two teams of five, where you work with your team to defend your base and destroy the opposing base. Based in the map "Summoner's Rift" the field is 
 split into two sides, occupied by either team. Located at the center of a team's base is the Nexus. If a team is able to destroy the oppoisng team's Nexus, they 
 will win. In doing so, teamwork and coordination is neccesary in order to succeed. This is why League of Legends is a team-based game. 
</p>

<p> 
 In addition to the base itself, on Summoner's Rift, there are three lanes where you are able to take your champion to. The lane at the top of the map is called 
 "Top Lane." The lane in the middle of the map is called "Middle Lane." And the lane at the bottom of the map if called "Bottom Lane." Each lane is home to a 
 different selection of champions which are more likely to do well when played in their respective lane. Traditionally, one player goes top, one player goes mid, 
 and two players go bot. One player on each team will play the Jungle role which occupies the areas between the lanes. Around every minute, a wave of mimions will
 be sent down the lanes. While the minions are quite week, they will attack enemy minions, champions, and structures. Killing a minion gives a small amount of gold.
 In the jungle, the jungler will fight Jungle Camps which are mini-neutral objectives that also give gold when killed.
</p>

<p>
 In each lane, there are two towers. Towers will attack enemies and protect you. In order to get closer to destroying the Nexus, you have to destroy the towers
 first. After the two towers in the lane are destroyed, you will reach the first part of the base. At the forefront is another tower infront of an inhibitor. The
 inhibitor does not attack anything. When the inhibitor is destroyed your minions will get a buff. Lastly, in the center of the base lies two more towers and the 
 nexus. These are the two strongest towers on the map, and are harder to destroy. When they are completely destroyed, you will be able to attack the nexus. As,
 stated earlier on, when the Nexus is destroyed, the game ends.

<h4>
 Gold and Items
</h4>

<p>
In League of Legends, killing most things will give you gold. Killing a minion can give anywhere from 14 to 90 gold, a Champion kill will give you anywhere from 
300 to 1,000 gold, and destroying a tower will give you 300 gold. With this gold, you can purchase items that buff up your champion and give stats. Most completed
items cost around 3,000 gold, while the components of those items cost around 1,000 gold. Different champion classes build different items that give different 
stats. Each player can have at most six items. It is recommended on all champions to buy a "Mythic Item." Mythic Items are items that give above average stats for 
there cost. Usually players tend to buy there Mythic Item as soon as possible. Each player can only build one Mythic.

<h4>
 Champions
</h4>

<p>
In each game, the player has the choice to choose what Champion they want to play. There are more than 150 playable champions that all have their own unique
abilities. There are many different classes that a champion may fit in. Champion classes are mostly dependant on what items they build, what lane they do best in,
and their damage type.
</p>

<p>
Each champion has their design and set of abilites that are unique to them. Every champion, except for a few, has three basic abilities, and an ultimate ability. 
To start, a champions basic abilites are binded to the Q, W, and E, keys respectively. Most champion's Q abilites do small amounts of damage, on low cooldowns. 
Next, most champion's W abilities have some sort of crowd control, which hinders enemy movement. Lastly, most champion's E abilites are a type of dash or movement.
Moving on to the Ultimate ability, each champion has one ability binded to the R key, that is their most powerful spell. It is likely to have a much longer cooldown
compared to the other abilities, but its effects are much more useful. A lot of champion's ultimate abilites are their largest output of damage.
