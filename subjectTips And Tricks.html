useful to know!

<p>
 - When you are starting out picking a champion can be hard. Instead of basing your choice off of playstyle, just go for a champion that you thinks looks cool
</p>

<p>
 - It is never worth it to flame your teamates in chat. It wont increase your chances of winning. On the other hand, giving compliments are sending a nice gesture
  their way can help a ton.
</p>

<p>
 - Every match is winnable. Try your best and dont give up.
</p>

<p>
 - When Zed uses ult on you, he will always appear behind you.
</p>

<p>
 - Playing ARAM or ARURF can be a good way to try new champions that you would not have tried otherwise.
</p>

<p>
 - Utilize practice tool as much as possible. Its great for learning a new champion.
</p>

<p>
 - The best time to recall in lane is when the next incoming minion wave has a cannon minion in it.
</p>

<p>
 - Always try your best to chain your CC. This will make getting kills a lot easier.
</p>

<p>
 - If you want to improve your last hitting skills, go to practice tool and pick a range champion with very low attack damage, such as Soraka. Try to last hit 
  as many minions as you can. Over time you will definately start to see some improvment.
</p>

<p>
 - Muting your teamates is one of the best things you can do to increase your chances of winning. Most of the time they have nothing imoportant to say.
</p>
