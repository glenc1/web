League of Legends is the biggest Esport in the world with viewers and fans all across the world. The League of Legends competetive scene is a home for many teams 
from regions in many different countries with players playing the game at the highest level possible. The four major regions are the LCS in North America, LCK in 
Korea, LEC in Europe, and LPL in China. Teams in these regions play against each other during the spring and summer split tournaments to have a chance at winning 
large cash prizes and other rewards. The top teams from these regions are recruited for international tournaments such as MSI and Worlds.

<h4>
LCS
</h4>
<img src="https://esportsobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-LCS-Logo-1.jpg" alt="LCS" class="center">
<p>
The LCS (League Championship Series) is the regional league for North America consisting of ten teams. The LCS format consists of two splits, the Spring Split and 
Summer Split. Both splits have teams play 18 regular season games, where the top 8 teams are eligible for playoffs. The playoffs format is a standard double 
elimination tournament where the teams faceoff against each other to being crowned as champions. The first place team wins a large cash prize, a LCS trophy, and a 
spot in MSI. The top 3 teams will recieve a spot in Worlds.
 
Historically, the teams from the LCS have not preformed well internationally, with the farthest a team reaching being MSI finals, and Worlds semi-finals. Being 
consistently out-prefromed by teams from other regions, team-owners have looked to bring imports from other regions over to North America to play for their team in
hopes of better results. An LCS team can have a maximum of two imports at a time. Imports are usually bought at large amounts of money, but their preformance may
not be as good as expected. As a result, some jokingly refer to the LCS as a retirment home. Notable players from the LCS include Doublelift, Bjergsen, Xmithie, 
Impact, Sneaky, Jensen, and Biofrost.

<h4>
LCK
</h4>

<p>
The LCK (League of Legends Champions Korea) is the regional league for South Korea consisting of 10 teams. Similarly to the LCS, the LCK has two splits, the Spring
Split and the Summer Split. The teams will compete against each other in best of three matches during the regular season for a spot in the playoffs. The top 6 teams
from the regular season compete in playoffs. Each team will compete in best of five matches, in a single elimination bracket. The first place team wins a large cash
prize, a LCK trophy, and a spot in MSI. The top 3-4 teams will compete at worlds.

In previous years, teams from the LCK have prefromed very well at international tournaments. The LCK has won worlds six out of the ten times, with three of them
being from the team SKT T1. Undoubtedly, SKT T1 is the greatest team of all time. Winning 3 world championships, there reign in the League of Legends competetive 
scene will forever be remebered. Led by team captain and star player, Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok, the greatest player of all time, SKT has been the most dominant team
to ever compete at Worlds. Notable players from the LCK include Faker, Bengi, Bang, Deft, Chovy, and Mata.

<h4>
LEC
</h4>

<p>
The LEC (League of Legends European Championship) is the regional league for Europe consisting of 10 teams. Just like the LCS and LCK, the LEC is split into two 
splits, the Spring Split and the Summer Split. Both splits have teams play 18 regular season games, where the top 8 teams are qualified for playoffs. The teams 
compete against each other to try their best at winning the tournament. The winning team recieves a large cash prize, an LEC trophy, and a spot in MSI. The top
3-4 teams recieve a spot at worlds.
 
Back in season 1 when Worlds only had teams from Europe and North America, a team from Europe, FNC, won. Many do not consider this to be a real Worlds Champion
title because the competition was limited. From then on, no team from the LEC would win a world championship. Both FNC in 2018 and G2 in 2019 have reached the 
Worlds Finals but both were swept by teams from the LPL. The LEC's international success is mesely comapred to the LCK and LPl but signs of hope for LEC fans have 
been appearing in recent years. In 2019, G2 won MSI, competing against the top teams from all the other regions. Unfortunately they were not able to translate that
success to Worlds. Notable players from the LEC include, Rekkles, Caps, Perkz, Jankos, Xpeke, Broxah.

<h4>
LPL
</h4>

<p>
The LPL (League of Legends Pro League) is the regional league for China, consisting of 17 teams. Similarly to the LCS, LCK, and LEC, the LPL uses a two split
format, with the Spring Split and the Summer Split. The 17 teams compete in best of three regular season matches. The top 8 teams qualify for playoffs. During
playoffs teams play best of five matches for a shot at winning the tournament. The first place team wins a large cash prize, a LPL trophy, and a spot in MSI.
The top 3-4 teams will recieve a spot at worlds.
 
In recent years, the LPL has been very dominant at international tournaments. Winning both the 2018 and 2019 World Championship, and reaching the finals at Worlds
2020, the tops teams from this region can compete at a very high level. While many of the best players in the LPL come from the LCK, there is a vast selection of 
native Chinese players who have had major sucess. Notable players from the LPL include Uzi, DoinB, TheShy, GoGoing, and Tian.
