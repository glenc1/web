<p>This website is a description of the speed typing test that I have created. 
A typing speed test measures the amount of words you can type within a given time frame.
The user will be presented with a list of generic everyday words, and will try and type as 
many words as possible.As soon as the first letter is typed, a timer begins. When the timer
reaches zero, the user will not be able to type anymore. If a word is typed incorrectly, it 
will not be counted towards the score. The final score that the user receives only includes the 
amount of words that were typed correctly with proper capitalization and punctuation if needed.</p>
