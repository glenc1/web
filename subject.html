     <p>League of Legends requires teamwork and synergy. This means that playing with friends is the best way to play. Gathering a group of 5 and queuing up can 
     serve as a fun way to spend time with friends.

     </h2>
     <p>Just like any other competitive video game, addictions can easily be formed. League of Legends is no exception to this. Many players end up getting caught
     up in League of Legend's ranked system, spending hours each day playing. As a result, things like sleep loss, lack of exercise, and decreasing quality of diet 
     may occur.
